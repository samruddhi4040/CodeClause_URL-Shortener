I wrote a Python code for an URL shortener as part of my internship project with Codeclause.  
The code uses a random string generator to create short URLs.
The code also stores the original URL and the short URL.
This allows users to easily access the original URL by clicking on the short URL.
The code is efficient and scalable, making it a good fit for a production environment.
THE IDE used was 'VSCode' as specified.
